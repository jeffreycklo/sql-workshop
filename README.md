Materials developed for the BISA x Deloitte workshop on 1st May 2019 at The University of Sydney.

### Instructions:
1. Please click the "Clone or download" green button on the above right, then click "Download ZIP".
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Go to https://sqliteonline.com/
4. On the top left, click "File", "Open DB" then open the `Northwind_altered.sqlite` file.

The student version contains the ERD for the database and activities only.
The full version contains all the slides, including activities and the solutions.


N.b. the `Northwind_altered.sqlite` file was altered for the purposes of the workshop, in particular to be consistent with the ERD diagram conventions. The original file by jpwhite3, who converted to the .sqlite format from the original Microsoft Access sample database called "Northwind", can be found [here](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3/blob/master/Northwind_small.sqlite).
