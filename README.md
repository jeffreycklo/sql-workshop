N.b. the `Northwind_altered.sqlite` file was altered for the purposes of the workshop, in particular to be consistent with the ERD diagram conventions. The original file by jpwhite3, who converted to the .sqlite format from the original Microsoft Access sample database called "Northwind", can be found [here](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3/blob/master/Northwind_small.sqlite).
